You are to create a text adventure game in the spirit of Zork and other similar games. The following are requirements for the game:
A minimum of 8 rooms
Each room should be its own function.
You can move freely between connected rooms (in other words, your game can’t be a single one-way road)
Your program should accept the commands north, east, south, and west (or some equivalent to these four commands) as well as look.
You should have at least one puzzle for the user to solve.
You should have an inventory in the game. The inventory should be instrumental for solving at least one puzzle. Remember that you can check if something is in a list using the "in" keyword.
Each room should have a description that is printed when you enter the room.
Your program should be well-organized, well-documented, and easy to read.
